/**
 * Her partner has to be looking at her cycle, not at a reconstruction of it.
 *
 * Two things were wrong, and both showed up as the ring on his screen
 * disagreeing with the ring on hers.
 *
 * **The day.** `partnerSafeService` asked for her cycle with
 * `referenceDate.toISOString().slice(0, 10)` -- the UTC calendar date -- which
 * overrode the timezone handling this service already does. Her phone counts
 * the day locally, so anywhere east of UTC he was a day behind for part of
 * every day. Reported from India: she read Day 16, he read Day 15.
 *
 * **The shape.** Her cycle length was computed here, used for every other
 * number, and never reported. Anything drawing a ring from this block had to
 * assume 28 days -- a shape belonging to nobody, under a heading with her name
 * on it.
